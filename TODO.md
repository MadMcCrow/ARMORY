### Armory

### Macro

[] PoC prototype : generate a playable map and render it in 3d.
[] Game design document : write a minimal pitch

### Game Design

we should focus on two points for the game design :
- resources are flow. they are infinite but require logistic
- units are essentially a rock paper scissors game with only counters.

[] Revise units and their relationship
[] Revise Economy and flow of resources

### System

[X] Map generation entirely in WorldMap
[X] tile set data definition
[] tile content as an object class (must be derivable for custom behaviour)
[] GDscript function to control generation
