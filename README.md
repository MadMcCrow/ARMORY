# ARMORY

Armory is a RTS inspired by abandonware _Arsenal : Taste The Power_

> A.R.S.E.N.A.L Taste the Power is a real-time strategy game created by Tactical Software for MS-DOS and released as shareware in 1997. A.R.S.E.N.A.L is still sold by its legal owner, but it is not compatible with modern OSes without some form of emulation of past hardware (ie. DosBox).

## Godot project
This project is made with the Godot Engine (here pronounced _/ˈɡɒdoʊ/_ _GOD-oh_) built from source with a `custom.py` file passing arguments to `scons` (the build tool).

### Setup on your device

to set the project up on your device, you need to have godot (https://github.com/godotengine/godot) cloned on your device and edit `Makefile` to fit your current setup. We recommend having Godot in the parent folder of ARMORY.

### Modular approach

The game will be (almost) entirely in C++. the code is added to modules in the sources folder.
